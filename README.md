üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jean Claude, a Software Engineer, AI Engineer, and Business Strategist passionate about building intelligent systems that drive meaningful impact.

With a strong foundation in full-stack development and applied AI, I specialize in designing and deploying robust, scalable solutions that combine software engineering best practices with modern machine learning techniques. My focus areas include large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), LangChain-based agents, and ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in leveraging AI to solve high-leverage problems in research, education, automation, and emerging markets. Recently, I‚Äôve been working on projects involving:

* üß† AI agents for knowledge retrieval and decision support
* ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow automation using n8n and low-code tools
* üìö Research tools powered by LLMs and vector databases
* üåê Python based backend systems with OpenAI-compatible APIs
* ü§ñ RAG pipelines with vLLM inference backends, custom embeddings, and fine-tuned control over generation
* üìà Strategies for deploying AI at scale in business and development contexts

I bring a strategic lens to every project, blending technical architecture with user-centered thinking. Whether it is designing user journeys, optimizing value delivery, or crafting GTM strategies, I aim to build systems that are not just functional but transformative.

üß≠ My long-term mission is to bridge advanced technology and real-world utility, especially within Africa‚Äôs innovation ecosystem, by contributing to open-source, collaborating on forward-thinking products, and mentoring others along the way.
